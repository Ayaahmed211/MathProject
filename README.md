# Prosthetic Movement Project

This repository showcases a comprehensive project designed to detect electromyography (EMG) signals and translate them into precise finger movements using a prosthetic hand. The implementation integrates machine learning algorithms for signal classification, Arduino for hardware control, and MATLAB for advanced data simulation and visualization.

## Project Overview

### 1. Machine Learning Module
The machine learning component processes EMG signals to predict prosthetic hand movements. A logistic regression model is employed to classify input signals, and predictions are relayed to an Arduino microcontroller to actuate servo motors. The module features a user-friendly graphical interface for real-time operation.

#### Key Features:
- Signal classification using a logistic regression model.
- Real-time predictions via an intuitive GUI.
- Communication with Arduino for hardware control.

### 2. Arduino Module
The Arduino module serves as the interface between the software and hardware, interpreting commands from the machine learning model to drive servo motors that control the prosthetic handâ€™s movements.

#### Key Features:
- Serial communication with the machine learning module.
- Reliable control of servo motors for accurate finger actuation.

### 3. MATLAB Module
The MATLAB component simulates the diffusion of signals in a spatial domain over time, offering insights into signal propagation and behavior. This module leverages finite element methods and provides a variety of visualization options.

#### Key Features:
- Advanced signal propagation simulations.
- Comprehensive visualization through 2D plots, 3D surface plots, and animations.
